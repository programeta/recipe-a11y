# Recipe a11y - Basic

This configuration recipe is designed for **Drupal 11** and provides a foundational setup to support key accessibility-related modules. It defines the necessary editor and text format configurations to ensure compatibility and usability with a curated set of modules that enhance content accessibility and editorial experience.

The recipe includes baseline configuration for the following modules, which are considered essential for accessibility-focused Drupal projects:

* **[Accessibility Indicator for Title Length](https://drupal.org/project/title_a11y)** – Helps content editors maintain optimal title lengths for accessibility and SEO.
* **[Linkit](https://drupal.org/project/linkit)** – Provides an intuitive interface for linking to internal content, improving usability and editorial efficiency.
* **[Menu Link Attributes](https://drupal.org/project/menu_link_attributes)** – Allows editors to add `aria` and other HTML attributes to menu links for improved accessibility.
* **[Editoria11y](https://drupal.org/project/editoria11y)** – A real-time accessibility checker that assists editors in identifying and resolving accessibility issues as they write.
* **[Landmark Roles](https://drupal.org/project/block_aria_landmark_roles)** - Adds additional elements to the block configuration forms that allow users to assign a ARIA landmark role and/or ARIA labels to a block.

This recipe ensures that these modules are properly integrated into the editor environment (`full_html` or `basic_html`), enabling a consistent and accessible content creation workflow out of the box.
